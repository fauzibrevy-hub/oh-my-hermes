# Routing quality gate

The meta-router has a deterministic golden evaluation in
`tests/test_routing_quality.py`. It is intentionally separate from individual
skill tests so catalog or scoring changes are reviewed against user-shaped
routing outcomes.

The gate currently measures:

- known-lane dispatch accuracy across representative research, planning,
  coding, memory, paper, visual, and feedback requests;
- ambiguity guardrail behavior, including bounded candidates and a high
  confidence threshold; and
- unknown-input fallback behavior, including explicit fallback metadata.

The current baseline is 100% (7/7) on the known-lane golden set. This is a
regression baseline, not a claim about production traffic. The next telemetry
step should measure the same dimensions from privacy-safe route metadata:
dispatch accuracy from operator corrections, clarification rate, fallback
rate, and confidence-margin distributions.

Local traces can be summarized with:

```bash
omh learning metrics
```

The metrics command reads only metadata-only learning traces. Operator
missed-route corrections are counted separately and may include an expected
workflow identifier, while prompts and operator notes remain excluded.

## Adding a trigger language pack

People type in their own language. A trigger language pack is how OMH
recognises one, and adding a language is authoring a data file — not editing
the router, the catalog, or any list of supported locales.

A pack is one JSON document per language:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "trigger_language_pack/v1",
  "language": "pt-br",
  "skills": {
    "frontend": ["página inicial", "layout responsivo"],
    "build-failure-triage": ["falha de build", "erro de compilação"]
  },
  "whole_phrase_only_tokens": {
    "adversarial-consensus": ["revisão"]
  }
}
```

There are two places a pack can live, and the difference matters:

- **Shipped with the repo** — `src/routing/trigger_packs/<lang>.json`. These are
  product data: they merge into the catalog itself, so scoring, the rendered
  `skills/*/SKILL.md` trigger lists, and `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` all read one
  trigger table. Adding one means regenerating those artifacts in the same
  commit (see the Generated Artifacts Map in `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Your own** — `~/.omh/routing/trigger-packs/<lang>.json`, beside
  `routing/model-chains.json`. These merge at the scoring layer only, so your
  local phrases change what your router recognises and never rewrite the
  repo's generated artifacts. `omh doctor` lists both, and names any pack it
  refused. The route hint the Hermes plugin shows in chat uses them only
  where Hermes' interpreter can import `omh`; see
  [What the Hermes interpreter must be able to import](INSTALLATION.md#what-the-hermes-interpreter-must-be-able-to-import).

Rules the validator enforces, and why:

- `language` must match the filename. The file name is the pack's identity.
- Every key under `skills` must be a real skill id. An entry naming a skill
  that does not exist is a refusal, never a silent drop — a phrase quietly
  attached to nothing, or to the wrong lane, is the failure mode a pack has
  to make impossible.
- A phrase must contain word characters, and a `whole_phrase_only_tokens`
  entry must produce at least one scored token. An entry the normalizer cannot
  see is dead weight its author believes is live.
- Every problem in a document is reported at once, so fixing a pack takes one
  round trip.

Two things to get right in the phrases themselves:

- **Short, natural, unambiguous.** Phrases match by containment, so a phrase
  generic enough to sit inside an ordinary sentence turns every such sentence
  into a dispatch. Prefer fewer, safer phrases over broad coverage.
- **Pay for them with negative controls.** Add cases to
  `ROUTING_PRECISION_CASES` in `src/quality/routing_precision.py` proving
  ordinary questions in that language still get answered rather than routed,
  and to `ROUTING_INTERVENTION_CASES` proving the lanes you claim are reached.
  Both corpora assert exact counts; update them in the same commit.
- **A Latin-script pack holds its own tokens back.** `ja`, `zh` and `ko` are
  written in scripts the English catalog does not use, so their phrases add no
  English token. A pack in a Latin-script language shares the token space, and
  every word its phrases introduce then scores on an unrelated English message:
  a first `id` draft moved 16 of the 1,553 routing cases, naming
  `feedback-triage` for "fix the crash barrier outside the payment office" and
  dropping `data-share-review` into a clarify shortlist it does not belong in.
  List each introduced token under that skill's `whole_phrase_only_tokens` so
  it credits the skill only inside a whole phrase, then re-run both corpora and
  require the result the pack's absence gives. Two tokens are never held back:
  one the skill already carries as a trigger, and one its own name, description
  or `use_when` carries, which reaches the router as `metadata_tokens` anyway
  and whose removal only empties the skill's anchor vocabulary.

Two gates hold the mechanism together. `tests/test_trigger_language_packs.py`
proves every shipped phrase is live in its skill's scored surface and that
every language with a shipped `--language` / `OMH_LANG` **output**
localization also ships a **trigger** pack, so input and output support cannot
diverge. `tests/test_trigger_holdback_reachability.py` proves no hold-back
entry, in any language, quietly removes nothing.

## Calibrating the corpus against real recorded decisions

`ROUTING_PRECISION_CASES` and `ROUTING_INTERVENTION_CASES` are hand-written.
That is right for guarding regressions and useless for answering "does this
corpus look like what the router actually sees?" Tuning a threshold against a
corpus nobody has compared to real traffic is tuning against an assumption.

`omh chat route --record` already writes the raw material: one
`runtime/runs/<run-id>/routing.json` per recorded decision, carrying the
`route_decision/v1` contract. `omh learning route-calibration` aggregates those
files — no network, no model.

```sh
# Record decisions as you use the router. --record is per invocation.
omh chat route --record "why is the build failing on main"

# Read them back. --json for the full payload.
omh learning route-calibration
omh learning route-calibration --since "" --json   # every record, ignoring the window
```

**What it can and cannot tell you.** A routing record stores `message_sha256`
and `message_length`, never the message. So the report calibrates *decision
distributions* — which router stages fire, how often the router is confident,
how thin its margins run — and never phrasings. A new corpus phrase still has
to come from an operator's own message; these numbers say whether the corpus's
shape is wrong, not which sentence to add.

The procedure:

1. **Record a working week's worth of real decisions.** One sample is noise.
   Anything you would otherwise have typed into Hermes goes through
   `omh chat route --record` instead.
2. **Read parse coverage first, before any other number.** The report opens
   with `parsed / routing records found`, and names every skipped record under
   a reason (`no_routing_record`, `unreadable_json`, `unexpected_schema`,
   `missing_recorded_at`, `recorded_before_since`). A format skew that silently
   dropped a third of the records would bias everything below it, and nothing
   else in the output would say so. An empty store reports coverage as
   unmeasured, not as 0%.
3. **Compare shape, not counts.** Corpus totals and recorded totals are not
   commensurate. What is comparable: the router-stage mix, the confidence mix,
   and the margin spread. A corpus whose cases are almost all `explicit` while
   real decisions are mostly `recommendation` is tuned for a router path the
   operator rarely takes.
4. **Read the day-normalized median, not the flat one.** Recorded routing runs
   carry no session id, so the recording day is the normalization unit and the
   payload says so. `normalized_median` is the median of per-day medians, so an
   afternoon of heavy recording cannot dominate. When the two disagree
   sharply, the flat median is describing one day.
5. **Mind the window.** `--since` defaults to the modification time of
   `src/routing/chat.py`, so the default report covers only decisions made by
   the current router. Widen it with an explicit `--since` when you want a
   before/after across a router change, and say which window a reported number
   came from.
6. **Then change one thing.** Add the cases, move the threshold, or adjust the
   triggers — and re-run both the corpus gates and this report, quoting the
   window and the parse coverage alongside any number you report.
